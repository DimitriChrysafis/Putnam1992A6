## Problem Statement
**_Definitive Putnam Problem_**

Four points are chosen independently and at random on the surface of a sphere (using the uniform distribution). What is the probability that the center of the sphere lies inside the resulting tetrahedron?


**Solution to Putnam 1992 A6**  
The documented code provided in ```/PythonFiles/simulation.py``` randomly choose 4 points on sphere millions of times
